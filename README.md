# SORT-O-MATIC
- This is the code for the project we made for the unit Data Capture and Technologies.
- Sort-O-Matic sorts the materials on the basis of the dielectric constants of the materials.
- It is capable of sorting the wastes into dry, wet and metallic categories.
- Only one type of waste can be segregated by the system at once.
- This system can also monitor the level of waste present in the dustbins with the help of an ultrasonic sensor. If the waste gets filled till the brim of the dustbin then the led attached to the system glows and 
  the buzzer buzzes to indicate the authorities about the filling up of dustbin.
